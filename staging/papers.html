            The annual ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing brings together researchers, developers, users, and
            practitioners interested in cloud computing. We solicit original contributions on all aspects of 
            cloud computing. We particularly encourage submissions on the research, development, 
            practice, and experience of cloud computing systems and data management. Specific topics 
            of interest include but are not limited to the following, when related to cloud:
            </p>

            <a id="submission"><h2>Submission categories</h2></a>
            <p>
              Authors are invited to submit original papers that are not being considered for publication in any other
              forum. A submission to the symposium may be one of the following types.
            </p>
            <ul>
	      <li>Research Papers describe original research, where novelty is a primary consideration.</li>
	      <li>Experience Papers describe industrial and academic experiences with existing systems, where lessons from the experience are a primary consideration.</li>
	      <li>Vision Papers describe speculative but well-reasoned and thought-provoking ideas, where insight is a primary consideration.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>
              Submissions will be judged based on their originality, technical merit, relevance, value to the community, 
              and likelihood of producing interesting discussions at the symposium. Submissions will be kept confidential 
              until accepted. Rejected submissions will be kept confidential permanently.
            </p>

            <p>
            Papers must meet the following formatting rules in order to be considered for publication.
            Submissions cannot be accompanied by nondisclosure, confidentiality, or similar agreements.
            Papers that violate these requirements will be rejected without reviews. Non-rejected papers 
            will be shepherded, and final acceptance will be conditional on the shepherdâ€™s approval.

            </p>
            
            <h3>Paper format & fonts</h3>
            <p>

            typeface, letter-sized paper, double column, a text block of 6.5 inches wide by 9 inches tall, 
            with numbered pages. A LaTeX template is available <a href="assets/template.tex" target="_blank">here</a>, but authors can use other templates 
            or editors that conform with the requirements. Judicious use of color is permitted, 
            but the paper should print clearly in black and white.
